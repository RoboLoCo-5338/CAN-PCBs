# CAN-PCBs
The goal of this project was to create multiple PCBs for our CAN Bus, including Star and Line boards, to increase resiliance. Both board types have holders designed to fit on standard 1" pegboard, and use screw terminals to connect devices, such as Talon SRXs, to the bus.

The files provided include the Eagle BRD and SCH files, as well as STL files for the holders we used that can be 3D printed.

The images folder contains images of the board in Eagle, a render of the holder, and images of the PCB and holder on our robot.
