# CAN-PCBs
The goal of this project was to create a PCB for our CAN Bus using a star topology for increased resilience. The board's holder was designed to fit on standard 1" pegboard and use screw terminals to connect devices, such as Talon SRXs, to the bus. Each board is designed to accommodate up to 10 CAN devices to connect, such as 8 Victor SPX's along with a PDP and RoboRio, and easy expansion is available by linking one board to another directly to increase to a total of 18 connections.

The files provided include the Eagle BRD, SCH, and EPF files, as well as STL files for the 3D printed holder. The DRU file used by our PCB manufacturer, [Silver Circuits](www.custompcb.com), is also provided. The holes on the holder are designed to accommodate these [heat-set inserts](https://www.mcmaster.com/#93365a132/=1b46wa6), installed using a standard soldering iron, to provide threaded insert holes. The board then uses at max 6 0.250" #6-32 bolts to be anchored down. 

The screw terminals are standard Wago 237-132 screw terminals obtained from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EZ3QPCU/). The terminating resistors are optional, but should one or two 120Î© resistors be added, the corresponding optional male headers **must** be added to enable or disable the resistor. The holes on the outer edge of the PCB can be used to add zip ties, by running a tie between a pari of holes, to hold the Yellow and Green CAN wire pairs to provide strain relief.

The images folder contains images of the board in Eagle, a render of the holder, and images of the PCB and holder on our robot.
